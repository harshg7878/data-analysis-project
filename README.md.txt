# Data Analysis Project

This project loads a CSV file, performs basic data-analysis using the Python libraries **pandas**, **matplotlib** and **seaborn**, and generates visualisations (bar chart, scatter plot and heatmap).  
The sample CSV included comprises sales data across regions, product categories, and key metrics (units sold, revenue, cost, profit).

## âœ… Features  
- Load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame  
- Print dataset preview (`head`), info and descriptive statistics (`describe`)  
- Compute and print mean, median and standard deviation for a selected numeric column  
- Create and save:  
  - Bar chart: average value by a categorical column  
  - Scatter plot: relationship between two numeric columns (with optional hue)  
  - Heatmap: correlation matrix of numeric variables  

## ðŸ§® Usage  
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  
2. Install dependencies:
